# Note Editor Compose Migration Status

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Compose UI Components Created
1. **NoteEditor.kt** - Main Compose UI with:
   - NoteEditorScreen (main scaffold)
   - NoteTypeSelector (Material 3 ExposedDropdownMenuBox)
   - DeckSelector (Material 3 ExposedDropdownMenuBox)
   - NoteFieldEditor (field cards with multimedia and sticky buttons)
   - ImageOcclusionButtons (for IO notes)
   - State management with data classes

2. **NoteEditorToolbar.kt** - Bottom toolbar with:
   - Text formatting buttons (bold, italic, underline)
   - Cloze deletion buttons (for cloze types)
   - Custom button support
   - Material 3 BottomAppBar

3. **NoteEditorViewModel.kt** - Business logic layer:
   - StateFlows for reactive state management
   - Collection/Note/Card integration
   - Field value updates
   - Sticky field toggling
   - Note saving logic

### Integration Completed
- Fragment updated to host ComposeView
- Layout XML simplified to single ComposeView container
- Original code backed up to `noteeditor/old/`
- Build errors resolved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete / Needs Work

### Fragment Legacy Code
The `NoteEditorFragment.kt` still contains ~3000 lines of legacy code that references XML views. Many of these have been **commented out** with TODO markers:

#### Commented Out (Needs Re-implementation):
1. **Line 487**: `baseSnackbarBuilder` - Snackbar anchor view
2. **Lines 803-815**: XML view initialization
   - `fieldsLayoutContainer`
   - `tagsButton`, `cardsButton`
   - `imageOcclusionButtonsContainer` and related buttons
3. **Lines 926-928**: Note type spinner setup
4. **Lines 997-1003**: Note type listener and tags button click handler
5. **Line 2001**: Tab order for accessibility
6. **Line 2537**: Editor layout reference for toolbar margins
7. **Lines 2959, 2967**: Tags button enable/disable

### How Legacy Code Works Now
- All commented code has TODO markers explaining what needs Compose implementation
- Fragment still contains methods that expect these views (may cause runtime errors)
- Multimedia, tags, templates, and image occlusion still use legacy Fragment methods

### Card Browser Integration
- `CardBrowserLayout.kt` split-view NoteEditor integration is commented out
- Needs proper integration after core editor is stable

## üî® Required Next Steps

### 1. Test Core Functionality ‚ö° PRIORITY
Build and test the app to verify:
- [ ] Note editor opens without crashes
- [ ] Can add new notes
- [ ] Can edit existing notes
- [ ] Field editing works
- [ ] Note type selection works
- [ ] Deck selection works

### 2. Re-implement Commented Features
For each commented TODO:

#### High Priority:
- [ ] **Multimedia buttons** - Clicking multimedia in field cards
  - Integrate with existing `MultimediaViewModel`
  - Hook up to Fragment's multimedia launchers
- [ ] **Tags functionality** - Tags dialog launch
  - Connect Compose button to existing `showTagsDialog()`
- [ ] **Cards/Templates button** - Template editor access
  - Connect to existing `showCardTemplateEditor()`
- [ ] **Image Occlusion buttons** - Edit/Select/Paste image
  - Integrate with existing IO infrastructure

#### Medium Priority:
- [ ] **Toolbar visibility/margins** - Handle compose toolbar layout
- [ ] **Enable/disable states** - Implement in ViewModel
  - Tags button during note type change
  - Other button states
- [ ] **Snackbar anchoring** - Use Compose Scaffold snackbar host

#### Low Priority:
- [ ] **Tab order/accessibility** - Implement Compose focus management
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts** - Verify still work with Compose

### 3. ViewModel Enhancement
Expand `NoteEditorViewModel` to handle:
- [ ] Multimedia operations
- [ ] Tags management
- [ ] Template editing triggers
- [ ] Image Occlusion operations
- [ ] Button enable/disable states

### 4. Remove Legacy Code
Once all functionality is re-implemented in Compose/ViewModel:
- [ ] Remove commented XML view references
- [ ] Remove unused Fragment methods
- [ ] Remove legacy field management code
- [ ] Clean up imports

### 5. Card Browser Integration
- [ ] Uncomment NoteEditor in `CardBrowserLayout.kt`
- [ ] Wire up proper state management for split view
- [ ] Test note editing from card browser

## üìã Testing Checklist

When ready to test:
- [ ] Add a new basic note
- [ ] Add a new cloze note
- [ ] Edit an existing note
- [ ] Change note type
- [ ] Change deck
- [ ] Add/remove tags
- [ ] Toggle sticky fields
- [ ] Add multimedia (image/audio/video/drawing/camera)
- [ ] Preview cards
- [ ] Save and verify changes persist
- [ ] Test with Image Occlusion notes
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test dark mode
- [ ] Test accessibility features

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Runtime Crashes Expected**: Many Fragment methods still expect XML views to exist. These will throw NullPointerExceptions until properly integrated.

2. **Multimedia May Not Work**: The multimedia buttons are in Compose UI but not hooked up to Fragment's multimedia infrastructure.

3. **Tags/Templates May Not Work**: Buttons exist in Compose but click handlers may not be connected.

4. **No Error Handling**: ViewModel and Compose don't have comprehensive error handling yet.

## üìù Architecture Notes

### Current State: Hybrid
- **Compose UI**: Visual presentation layer
- **Fragment**: Still owns business logic, multimedia, tags, templates
- **ViewModel**: Basic state management, needs expansion

### Target State: Clean MVVM
- **Compose UI**: Pure presentation
- **ViewModel**: All business logic and state
- **Fragment**: Minimal - just hosts Compose and handles system integration

### Migration Strategy
Incremental approach:
1. ‚úÖ Create Compose UI (done)
2. ‚úÖ Create basic ViewModel (done)
3. ‚è≥ Test core functionality (current step)
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Move functionality from Fragment to ViewModel
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Connect Compose UI to ViewModel operations
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Remove legacy Fragment code

## üí° Tips for Contributors

1. **Search for TODO comments** in `NoteEditorFragment.kt` to find areas needing work
2. **Don't remove commented code** until replacement Compose implementation is tested
3. **Test frequently** - small incremental changes are safer
4. **Use ViewModel** - move logic out of Fragment wherever possible
5. **Preserve functionality** - all original features must work after migration
