/**
 * Dialog that prompts the user to confirm a one-way sync.
 *
 * A one-way sync (also known as a full sync) occurs when the local database schema is modified
 * in a way that cannot be merged with the server's version. When this happens, the user must
 * choose to either overwrite the server with their local collection or overwrite their local
 * collection with the server's version.
 *
 * This dialog is typically triggered when an operation throws a [com.ichi2.anki.libanki.exception.ConfirmModSchemaException],
 * indicating that a schema modification requires a full sync.
 *
 * If the user confirms, [com.ichi2.anki.libanki.Collection.modSchemaNoCheck] is called to bypass
 * the safety check and force the schema modification, effectively marking the collection for a one-way sync.
